## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide: Common Issues & Solutions

Despite careful planning, issues can arise during migration. Here's how to address common challenges from a business perspective.

### Pre-Migration Issues

| Challenge | Business Impact | Solution Approach | Preventive Measures |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Incomplete Discovery** | Surprise applications or dependencies | Conduct additional discovery sessions with business units | Include business stakeholders in validation workshops |
| **Unrealistic Timelines** | Missed deadlines, rushed execution | Re-baseline project with realistic estimates | Build 20-30% buffer into initial plans |
| **Skill Gaps** | Delayed implementation, quality issues | Engage partners or training resources | Assess team capabilities early, train proactively |
| **Unclear Success Criteria** | Inability to validate success | Define specific, measurable objectives | Create formal success criteria with stakeholders |

### Migration Execution Issues

| Challenge | Business Impact | Solution Approach | Preventive Measures |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Performance Problems** | Poor user experience | Rapid assessment and remediation team | Test thoroughly before full cutover |
| **Extended Downtime** | Business disruption | Invoke rollback procedures if necessary | Practice cutover procedures multiple times |
| **Security or Compliance Gaps** | Regulatory risk | Immediate remediation of critical issues | Pre-migration compliance validation |
| **Integration Failures** | Broken business processes | Focused technical response team | Map and test all system integrations |

### Post-Migration Issues

| Challenge | Business Impact | Solution Approach | Preventive Measures |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Cost Overruns** | Budget exceptions | Immediate optimization assessment | Implement proper tagging and budgets upfront |
| **User Resistance** | Reduced productivity | Enhanced communication and training | Involve users early in the process |
| **Operational Confusion** | Support delays | Clarify responsibilities and procedures | Define operational model before migration |
| **Performance Degradation** | Business slowdown | Technical optimization assessment | Establish performance baselines and monitor |

### Escalation Framework

When issues arise, follow this structured approach to resolution:

1. **Assess Impact**:
   - How many users/systems are affected?
   - Is there a workaround available?
   - What is the business impact of the issue?

2. **Categorize Severity**:
   - **Critical**: Business stoppage, no workaround, revenue impact
   - **High**: Major function impacted, limited workaround
   - **Medium**: Function impacted, workaround available
   - **Low**: Minor issue, minimal business impact

3. **Engage Resources**:
   - **Critical/High**: Activate incident response team
   - **Medium**: Assign to migration team with timeline
   - **Low**: Document for planned resolution

4. **Communicate Status**:
   - Share transparent updates with defined frequency
   - Focus on business impact and resolution timeline
   - Document lessons learned for future migrations

> **Pro Tip**: *"Create a dedicated 'SWAT team' of technical and business experts who can quickly address critical issues during migration cutover periods. This team should have decision-making authority to resolve problems rapidly."*
