# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## üéØ General Migration Questions

**Q: What is cloud migration and why should I consider it?**  
A: Cloud migration is the process of moving data, applications, and IT processes from on-premises infrastructure to a cloud computing environment like Azure. Benefits include cost reduction (typically 30-40%), improved scalability, enhanced security, better disaster recovery, and access to cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning.

**Q: What's the difference between Rehost and Refactor migration strategies?**  
A: 
- **Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)**: Moving applications to Azure with minimal or no changes. Faster implementation (weeks to months) with immediate cost savings, but limited cloud benefits.
- **Refactor**: Modifying applications to better leverage cloud-native features. Takes longer (months to a year) but provides maximum cloud benefits including auto-scaling, microservices, and PaaS services.

**Q: How long does a typical Azure migration take?**  
A: Timeline varies by scope and complexity:
- Small environments (1-50 VMs): 2-4 months
- Medium environments (50-200 VMs): 4-8 months  
- Large enterprises (200+ VMs): 8-18 months
- Assessment and planning typically take 25% of total project time

**Q: What does Azure migration typically cost?**  
A: Migration costs vary but typically include:
- Assessment tools: Often free (Azure Migrate)
- Professional services: $50-200 per VM for rehost, $200-500 per application for refactor
- Temporary dual-running costs: 10-20% of monthly Azure spend
- Training and certification: $2,000-10,000 per team
- Most organizations see ROI within 6-18 months

## üìã Planning & Assessment

**Q: How do I assess if my applications are ready for Azure migration?**  
A: Use a structured assessment approach:
1. **Inventory Discovery**: Use Azure Migrate to discover all VMs, applications, and dependencies
2. **Compatibility Analysis**: Check OS versions, application compatibility, and licensing requirements
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Understand application interconnections using Service Map
4. **Performance Analysis**: Review CPU, memory, storage, and network requirements
5. **Business Impact Assessment**: Evaluate criticality, compliance needs, and downtime tolerance

**Q: What are the key prerequisites before starting migration?**  
A: Essential prerequisites include:
- **Network connectivity**: ExpressRoute or VPN established to Azure
- **Azure subscription setup**: With proper IAM roles and resource organization
- **Landing zone preparation**: Core infrastructure including VNets, security groups, and monitoring
- **Backup strategy**: Both for rollback and business continuity
- **Team readiness**: Staff training on Azure services and migration tools
- **Change management**: Communication plan and stakeholder alignment

**Q: How do I prioritize which applications to migrate first?**  
A: Use this prioritization framework:
1. **Start with low-risk applications**: Development, test, or non-critical systems
2. **Consider application complexity**: Simple web servers before complex databases
3. **Evaluate business impact**: Lower business-critical applications first
4. **Check dependencies**: Applications with fewer dependencies are easier
5. **License compatibility**: Applications with Azure-compatible licensing
6. **Compliance requirements**: Non-regulated applications before heavily regulated ones

**Q: What compliance and regulatory considerations should I address?**  
A: Key compliance areas include:
- **Data residency**: Ensure data stays in required geographic regions
- **Industry regulations**: HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001 compliance
- **Data classification**: Identify and protect sensitive data appropriately
- **Audit requirements**: Maintain detailed logs and documentation
- **Privacy regulations**: GDPR, CCPA compliance for personal data
- **Government requirements**: FedRAMP for government workloads

- Consider Azure Files, Azure NetApp Files, or blob storage based on access patterns

**Q: How do I ensure minimal downtime during migration?**  
A: Minimize downtime strategies:
- **Use replication-based migration**: Azure Site Recovery for VMs
- **Implement blue-green deployments**: Maintain parallel environments
- **Plan maintenance windows**: Schedule during low-usage periods
- **Test migration procedures**: Practice with non-production systems
- **Prepare rollback plans**: Quick recovery if issues arise
- **Use staged approaches**: Migrate in waves rather than all at once
