# Refactor Strategy

This section covers modernizing applications and services during migration to take better advantage of cloud capabilities.

In software development, refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Its intent is to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software. This chapter will cover various aspects of refactoring, including:

- Code Smells: Indicators that there might be a deeper problem in the code.
- Refactoring Techniques: Common methods for refactoring code, such as extracting methods or classes.
- Best Practices: Guidelines to follow when refactoring to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Tools: Software that can assist in the refactoring process.

## Code Smells

Code smells are patterns in code that may indicate underlying problems. Some common code smells include:

- **Duplicated Code**: The same code structure appears in multiple places.
- **Long Method**: A method that is too long and does too much.
- **Large Class**: A class that has too many responsibilities.
- **Long Parameter List**: A method or function that takes too many parameters.

Identifying code smells is the first step in the refactoring process. Once smells are identified, appropriate refactoring techniques can be applied.

## Refactoring Techniques

There are several common techniques used in refactoring, including:

- **Extract Method**: Taking a piece of code and turning it into a new method.
- **Inline Method**: The opposite of extract method, where a method's body is moved into the caller's body.
- **Extract Class**: Creating a new class and moving part of the original class's code into the new class.
- **Inline Class**: Merging two classes into one.

These techniques help to reduce code smells and improve the overall structure and readability of the code.

## Best Practices

When refactoring, it's important to follow best practices to ensure that the code remains functional and maintainable. Some best practices include:

- **Keep It Simple**: Don't make the code more complicated than it needs to be.
- **Make It Work**: Ensure that the code still works after refactoring.
- **Test Coverage**: Have adequate tests in place to catch any issues introduced during refactoring.
- **Refactor in Small Steps**: Make small, incremental changes rather than large, sweeping ones.

## Tools

There are various tools available that can assist with refactoring, such as:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Features**: Many IDEs have built-in refactoring tools.
- **Static Code Analyzers**: These can identify code smells and suggest refactoring opportunities.
- **Automated Refactoring Tools**: Standalone tools that can perform refactoring automatically.

Using the right tools can greatly enhance the refactoring process, making it faster and more efficient.

## Conclusion

Refactoring is a crucial part of software development that helps to improve code quality and maintainability. By understanding and applying the concepts of code smells, refactoring techniques, best practices, and tools, developers can ensure that their code remains clean, efficient, and easy to work with.
