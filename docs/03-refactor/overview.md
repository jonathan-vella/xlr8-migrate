## 🎯 What is Refactor (Replatform)?

**Refactoring** involves making strategic modifications to applications to leverage cloud-native services and capabilities. Think of it as renovating your house - you keep the same foundation but upgrade systems for better efficiency, performance, and functionality.

### 🏗️ Core Concept
