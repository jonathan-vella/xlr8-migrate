# 📦 Rehost Strategy Overview

**Lift and Shift: Moving to Azure with minimal changes**

---

## 🎯 What is Rehost (Lift & Shift)?

**Rehosting** is the process of moving applications from on-premises infrastructure to Azure cloud **without modifying the application code**. Think of it as relocating your office to a new building - you're moving the same furniture and equipment, just to a better location.

### 🏗️ Core Concept

## ✅ Key Benefits of Rehost

### 🚀 **Speed & Simplicity**
- **⚡ Fastest migration path** - typically weeks vs. months
- **🔧 Minimal complexity** - no code changes required
- **📋 Predictable process** - well-established methodologies
- **👥 Lower skill requirements** - infrastructure focus vs. development

### 💰 **Cost Effectiveness**
- **🎯 Lower upfront investment** in migration effort
- **💵 Immediate cost benefits** from cloud infrastructure
- **📊 Predictable migration costs** - mainly infrastructure setup
- **⏰ Faster time to value** - quicker business benefits

### 🛡️ **Risk Reduction**
- **🔒 Application stability** - no code changes mean lower risk
- **📋 Proven migration patterns** - mature tooling and processes
- **🔙 Easier rollback** if issues occur
- **👨‍💼 Business continuity** - minimal disruption to operations

### 📈 **Strategic Advantages**
- **🏁 Quick wins** for cloud adoption initiatives
- **🎓 Learning opportunity** for cloud operations
- **🔄 Foundation for future optimization** - can refactor later
- **✅ Compliance maintenance** - keeps existing security posture

## 🎯 Ideal Rehost Scenarios

### ✅ **Perfect Candidates**

#### 🏢 **Legacy Enterprise Applications**
```
Examples:
├── 📊 ERP Systems (SAP, Oracle)
├── 🗄️ Legacy databases with complex schemas
├── 📝 Document management systems
└── 🔧 Custom business applications with dependencies
```

#### ⏰ **Time-Critical Migrations**
```
Scenarios:
├── 🏢 Data center closures or lease expiration
├── 📋 Compliance mandates with tight deadlines
├── 💰 Budget cycles requiring quick cloud adoption
└── 🛡️ Security incidents requiring rapid migration
```

#### 🛠️ **Complex Dependencies**
```
Characteristics:
├── 🔗 Tightly coupled application components
├── 🗄️ Shared databases across multiple applications
├── 🌐 Complex networking requirements
└── 🔐 Specialized security configurations
```

## 🚫 Rehost Limitations

### ⚠️ **What Rehost Doesn't Provide**

- **📈 Limited performance optimization** - same application bottlenecks remain
- **💰 Higher long-term costs** - VM management overhead continues
- **🔧 Ongoing maintenance burden** - OS patching, security updates
- **📊 No cloud-native benefits** - auto-scaling, managed services

### 🛑 **Poor Rehost Candidates**

#### ❌ **Applications That Shouldn't Be Rehosted**
```
Avoid Rehost for:
├── 🕰️ End-of-life applications (retire instead)
├── 📱 Modern web applications (refactor to PaaS)
├── 🔄 Applications with frequent updates (benefit from DevOps)
└── 💸 Cost-sensitive workloads (PaaS often cheaper)
```

### 🛠️ **Service Mapping Guide**

| On-Premises Component | Azure Equivalent | Purpose |
|----------------------|------------------|---------|
| **🖥️ Physical Servers** | Azure Virtual Machines | Primary compute resources |
| **💾 Local Storage** | Azure Managed Disks | Persistent storage for VMs |
| **🌐 Network Switches** | Virtual Network | Network connectivity |
| **🔥 Firewalls** | Network Security Groups | Traffic filtering |
| **⚖️ Load Balancers** | Azure Load Balancer | Traffic distribution |
| **📊 Monitoring Tools** | Azure Monitor | Performance monitoring |
| **🔄 Backup Systems** | Azure Backup | Data protection |

## 📊 Rehost vs. Stay On-Premises

### 💰 **Cost Comparison Example**

```mermaid

title: 3-Year Cost Comparison
---
xychart-beta
    title "Total Cost of Ownership (3 Years)"
    x-axis [Year 1, Year 2, Year 3]
    y-axis "Cost ($1000s)" 0 --> 200
    bar [150, 120, 120]
    line [100, 85, 85]
```

**📈 Breakdown:**
- **🔴 On-Premises Bar**: Hardware refresh, maintenance, facility costs
- **🔵 Azure Rehost Line**: VM costs with reserved instances and optimization

### ⚡ **Performance Considerations**

| Aspect | On-Premises | Azure Rehost | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **🚀 Performance** | Baseline | Similar to baseline | Network latency may vary |
| **📈 Scalability** | Limited by hardware | Manual scaling | Can add VMs as needed |
| **🔄 Availability** | Hardware dependent | 99.95% SLA | Azure infrastructure reliability |
| **🛡️ Security** | Your responsibility | Shared responsibility | Azure handles infrastructure security |
